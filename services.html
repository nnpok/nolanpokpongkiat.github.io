					COMPREHENSIVE EYE EXAM
				</div>
				<div class="whitebox">
					At Dr Si Optometry, Dr Si and our entire Los Angeles optometry team are
					committed to providing advanced vision care in a professional and
					comfortable environment. As an optometrist in Hollywood, our primary
					eye care service includes a complete eye exam that analyzes eye health
					and vision function. In addition to eye exams and vision testing,
					Dr. Si and our team of optometry professionals provide testing for
					glaucoma, cataracts and macular degeneration. We also offer glasses,
					contact lenses, and pre- and post-operative care. Eye exams should be
					scheduled yearly to monitor eye health and changes in prescription.

					CONTACT LENSES
				</div>
				<div class="whitebox">
					The examination for contact lenses includes a standard ocular health
					checkup, along with a specialized procedure for fitting your contact
					lenses. As Dr Si is committed to the well-being and satisfaction of
					his patients, a follow-up appointment is required after initial
					examination to assess the wellness of fit of your contact lenses.
					With this examination, youâ€™ll receive both a prescription for contact
					lenses as well as a prescription for eye glasses. Some of the contact
					lenses we provide include rigid gas permeable lenses, colored contact
					lenses, daily use contact lenses, weekly-use contact lenses, and monthly
					use lenses.

					WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT?
				</div>
				<div class="whitebox">
					Throughout his 30 years of practice, Dr Si has seen a trend of patients
					that have come in with symptoms of headaches, migraines, dry eyes,
					dizziness, nausea, and light sensitivity. These patients have often
					been to multiple doctors from many specialties, but have been turned
					back and been told their symptoms are normal and not treatable.
					However, with research both in the lab and clinically derived from the
					work of Helen Irlen, Dr Si has developed a solution to these symptoms
					through the use of colored lenses. In short, this new treatment blocks
					harmful wavelengths of light from entering the eye, improving brain function.
